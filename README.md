# Gitprofile-restAPI
JAVASCIPRT ONLY - Dynamically updating API that searches for github users


# API LIMIT
This simple front-end set up uses axios to send requests to the github api https://api.github.com.

As with most API's there is a limit to how many requests can be made within a certain period of time,and thus this will not work after a certain amount of requests.
